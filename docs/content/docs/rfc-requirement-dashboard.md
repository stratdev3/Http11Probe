This dashboard classifies every Http11Probe test by its [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) requirement level (**MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, **"ought to"**), with the exact RFC quote that proves it. Tests are grouped by requirement level, then by suite.

## Summary

| Requirement Level | Count | Meaning (RFC 2119) |
|---|---|---|
| **MUST** | 113 | Absolute requirement — no compliant implementation may deviate |
| **SHOULD** | 29 | Recommended — valid exceptions exist but must be understood |
| **MAY** | 10 | Truly optional — either behavior is fully compliant |
| **"ought to"** | 1 | Weaker than SHOULD — recommended but not normative |
| **Unscored** | 51 | Informational — no pass/fail judgement |
| **N/A** | 11 | Best-practice / no single RFC verb applies |

**Total: 215 tests**

---

## MUST-Level Requirements (113 tests)

These tests enforce absolute RFC requirements. A compliant server has no discretion — it **MUST** behave as specified.

### MUST — Reject with 400 (No Alternatives)

These are the strictest tests: the RFC mandates exactly `400 (Bad Request)`. Connection close alone does **not** satisfy the requirement.

| # | Test ID | Suite | RFC | RFC Quote |
|---|---------|-------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | `RFC9110-5.6.2-SP-BEFORE-COLON` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-5) | "A server **MUST** reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon." |
| 2 | `RFC9112-5.1-OBS-FOLD` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-5.2) | "A server that receives an obs-fold in a request message that is not within a 'message/http' container **MUST** either reject the message by sending a 400 (Bad Request)... or replace each received obs-fold with one or more SP octets." |
| 3 | `RFC9112-7.1-MISSING-HOST` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2) | "A server **MUST** respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host header field line or a Host header field with an invalid field value." |
| 4 | `RFC9110-5.4-DUPLICATE-HOST` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2) | "A server **MUST** respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any... request message that contains more than one Host header field line or a Host header field with an invalid field value." |
| 5 | `COMP-DUPLICATE-HOST-SAME` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2) | "A server **MUST** respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any... request message that contains more than one Host header field line..." (applies even when both values are identical) |
| 6 | `RFC9112-3-CR-ONLY-LINE-ENDING` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-2.2) | "A recipient of such a bare CR **MUST** consider that element to be invalid or replace each bare CR with SP before processing the element or forwarding the message." |

### MUST — Reject (400 or Connection Close Acceptable)

The RFC requires rejection, but the mechanism (400 status or connection close) has some flexibility.

| # | Test ID | Suite | RFC | RFC Quote |
|---|---------|-------|-----|-----------|
| 7 | `RFC9112-5-EMPTY-HEADER-NAME` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-5) | Grammar: `field-name = token`, `token = 1*tchar`. An empty field name violates 1*tchar (requires at least one character). |
| 8 | `RFC9112-5-INVALID-HEADER-NAME` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-5) | Grammar: `token = 1*tchar`, `tchar = "!" / "#" / ...`. Brackets are not in the tchar set — implicit **MUST** reject. |
| 9 | `RFC9112-5-HEADER-NO-COLON` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-5) | Grammar: `field-line = field-name ":" OWS field-value OWS`. The colon is mandatory — implicit **MUST** reject. |
| 10 | `COMP-WHITESPACE-BEFORE-HEADERS` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-2.2) | "A recipient that receives whitespace between the start-line and the first header field **MUST** either reject the message as invalid or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further processing." |
| 11 | `RFC9112-3-MISSING-TARGET` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3) | Grammar: `request-line = method SP request-target SP HTTP-version`. Missing target violates mandatory grammar — implicit **MUST**. |
| 12 | `COMP-ASTERISK-WITH-GET` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2.4) | "If a proxy receives an OPTIONS request with an absolute-form of request-target in which the URI has an empty path and no query component, then the last proxy on the request chain **MUST** send a request-target of '*' when it forwards the request to the indicated origin server." Only OPTIONS may use asterisk-form. |
| 13 | `COMP-HOST-WITH-USERINFO` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.2) | "A server **MUST** respond with a 400 (Bad Request)... to any request message that contains... a Host header field with an invalid field value."

| 17 | `COMP-VERSION-LEADING-ZEROS` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-2.3) | Grammar: `HTTP-version = HTTP-name "/" DIGIT "." DIGIT`. Each version component is exactly one DIGIT — "01" is two digits. **MUST** reject. |
| 18 | `COMP-VERSION-WHITESPACE` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-2.3) | Grammar: `HTTP-version = HTTP-name "/" DIGIT "." DIGIT`. No whitespace is permitted within the version token. **MUST** reject. |

Grammar: `request-line = method SP request-target SP HTTP-version`. **MUST** reject. |
| 19 | `RFC9112-6.1-CL-NON-NUMERIC` | Compliance | [RFC 9112 §6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-6.3) | "If a message is received without Transfer-Encoding and with an invalid Content-Length header field, then the message framing is invalid and the recipient **MUST** treat it as an unrecoverable error... the server **MUST** respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the connection." |
