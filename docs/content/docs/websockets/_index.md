The HTTP `Upgrade` mechanism allows a client to request switching to a different protocol on the same connection. The most common use is the WebSocket handshake. RFC 9110 Section 7.8 and RFC 6455 define strict requirements for when a server may respond with `101 Switching Protocols`.

## Key Rules

**Connection header required** — a server must not switch protocols unless the request includes `Connection: Upgrade`:

> "A server MUST NOT switch to a protocol that was not indicated by the client in the corresponding request's Upgrade header field." — RFC 9110 Section 7.8

**Method** — RFC 6455 Section 4.1 requires the WebSocket opening handshake to use GET. A POST with Upgrade headers must not trigger a 101.

**Version negotiation** — if the server does not support the requested WebSocket version, it should respond with `426 Upgrade Required` and include `Sec-WebSocket-Version` listing supported versions.
